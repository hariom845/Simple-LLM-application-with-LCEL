## Converting English Text Into Any Other Language :- A Simple LLM application with LCEL
Here I am building a simple LLM application with LangChain. This application will translate text from English into another language. This is a relatively simple LLM application - it's just a single LLM call plus some prompting. Still, this is a great way to get started with LangChain - a lot of features can be built with just some prompting and an LLM call!

After these I will be able to handle the operations:- 

- Using language models

- Using PromptTemplates and OutputParsers

- Using LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) to chain components together

- Debugging and tracing your application using LangSmith

- Deploying your application with LangServe

-- We will use open source models like LLama3, Gemma2, Mistral here, for these we are taking help of GROQ Platform
